        <ul>
            <li>You throw the dice.</li>
            <li>You choose if you think the next throw will be higher or lower than your last throw.</li>
            <li>Choose how many coins you want to use, the more you use the more is on the line!</li>
            <li>Did you get it right? You double your stake, if you get it wrong you lose all of the coins, so be careful! </li>
            <li>You are game over if you lose all of your coins, you win if you get to 100 coins.</li>
            <li>You can put a max of 10 coins for each throw, and a minimum of 1 coin.</li>
            <li>You start with 5 coins</li>
